            Hello World! If you've stumbled upon my website I must first take a moment to thank you for entering a part of my world.
            I am a big data analyst at a Fortune 50 company in the great state of Colorado. This last sentence might be a lie unless I get a job offer!
            This is my first website and I will be using it as a place to learn computer and data science and other interesting topics.
          </p>
          <p>
            What exactly is a data scientist?
            I've heard it described as someone who knows more computer science
            than a statistician and someone who knows more statistics than a computer scientist.
            I think this is accurate because it highlights that data science is really a combination of statistics, computer science, and business expertise. It allows businesses to leverage their data to drive efficiencies and save money or make more money by delivering a better produce. For this reason, I am going to create a section that is devoted to data analysis on kaggle competitions or important and interesting topics.
          </p>
          <p>
            The next section of my website will be similar a blog where I write about my journey to becoming a data analyst and hopefully one day, a data scientist. Prior to my last job I did a few code academy courses on HTML, CSS, PHP, and Ruby. I did not complete a single class and usually completed less than 50%. I didn't have a computer science background so things really weren't making sense until my last job where I started as an Excel monkey and then automated parts of my job with VBA. Out of necessity I turned to R and have become more interested in learning general coding practices and understanding algorithms like bubble sort, binary searches, or whatever. So I wanted to create a section where I could blog about how I've learned to code and the difficulties I've faced with things and the light bulb moments when things began to click.
          </p>
          <p>
            This last section will be something I reference often. It will be a compilation of useful resources such as wiki links, Youtube videos, or other educational sites that I've found worthwhile.
