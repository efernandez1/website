This is my first attempt at a blog post so it will probably be a little rough around the edges.
The purpose of the blog section is to provide some background into my life,
important topics in data science, and other interesting tidbits.

So a little bit about me - I was basically born and raised in Florida then moved
to Colorado when I finished my associate’s degree. Once in Colorado, I finished
my bachelor’s degree in Economics at the University of Colorado Boulder. I was
thankful to get a job offer before graduation which was a big relief going into
finals. Nonetheless, once on the job I quickly realized it was a glorified data
entry position. The pay was good, but the job was so boring that after a year
and a half, I left and started a new job as a business operations analyst. This
job was so much more technical (at least so I thought initially). I basically
became an Excel and Access monkey churning out half-ass analysis because
quantity was more important than quality – something I couldn't stand. After
repeatedly doing the same tasks, I invested in learning VBA, which made my life
so much easier. As a result, I was given more responsibilities and more important
projects that allowed me to learn more about data analysis and ultimately data science.
These projects quickly outgrew the limitations of Excel so I started learning R -
a much more rigorous statistical analysis programing language capable of handling
whatever I threw at it. The learning curve was steep, but after a few months
I really began to understand the value in what I was doing. R is such a powerful
language and depending who you talk to, is the most important programming language to
learn for data science - the other being Python. This is where my story catches up with my life.
I’m looking for a new job that will allow me to continue learning about data science
and using R along with other big data tools (hadoop, spark, splunk, etc).

From what I've said up to this point, you can probably tell that personal
growth is very important to me. I once heard it said, that in order to be happy,
you have to keep growing - whether it’s professionally, emotionally, physically,
or spiritually. The feeling of accomplishment when you can look back and see how
far you've come is awesome. Its almost hard for me to believe that in a little
less than 3 years I've graduated college, gone through two jobs, learned VBA,
SQL, R, HTML, CSS and even bought two houses! I’m so thankful for everything
that’s happened in my life up until this point. I really am curious to see
what things could happen in my future.</p>

  Now that you know a little bit about me, lets talk about some more technical
  topics. Something I wanted to quickly touch on was how to get a website up
  and running. I was a little confused at first so hopefully this can help somebody out.

  There are a few steps required to create and build a website aside from the
  html/css programming. First is to acquire/buy a domain/website name - in my
  case, www.alphanalyics.net. This is not enough. If you type your newly
  purchased domain name into your web browser, you will be sadly mistaken.
  This is because your website is not hosted on any server. There are several
  ways to host your website, but I found the easiest choice to be
  www.siteground.com or www.hostgator.com . Now you have a domain and website
  address, you’ve hosted your website, and now you must “point” your name
  servers to the hosting company. In my case, I bought my website from Google and
  then hosted it on Siteground. I thought everything was done at this point, but
  I was not able to get to a website. It was because the name servers on my
  domain name were not pointed to Siteground. I’m glossing over things very
  quickly, but the internet is just a series of routers and switches directing computer traffic from one computer to another.
  Literally information is sent along paths to routing stations that direct the
  traffic to its next destination. Buying a domain does nothing to direct this
  traffic. It still isn’t enough to host the website on Siteground servers.
  It was only after I specified where that server was located that I could begin
  to access the website. Specifying the location of my website on the server
  allows other routers and switches all around the world to know where to
  go to find my website. I guess the whole process is like ordering a
  pizza from your favorite pizza delivery joint. Buying a domain is like finding
  the name of the pizza place. Placing your pizza
  order is like hosting a website on a server. The order is not complete
  until you tell the person on the phone where to deliver the pizza aka pointing
  the name servers. The only difference is that it takes 48-72 hours for your
  website to propogate across all the servers in the world so it knows where
  to direct the internet traffic once your website is entered into a browser.

  I hoped to touch on other technical topics in this post, but I’ve already
  spent too much time on buying, hosting, and pointing your website. Instead
  I’m going to have a data science blog to go over important topics and leave
  this post as it is. I suggest watching this video to get a better
  understanding of how the internet really works. Its critical to understand
  these sort of things as opposed to taking them for granted.

Lets talk data science! To me, data science means leveraging data to gain
insights and drive real world decisions. Whether its in your business or in
your personal life. We all do data science on some level. From the soccer mom
who has to decide which soccer team is best for Billy to Google who is
developing world changing algorithms that will power our future.

The data science process begins by asking a question. This is the root of your
analysis and will need to be a clear question. For example, what measurable
factors contribute to a disgruntled employee who is looking to leave? The next
step is to
